This is my Programming Assignment #1 in Advanced Computer Programming!

This repository contains my demonstration of the given code problems. each problem has a different output, it sorts, it replace and it access.
How does my codes works?

In the Alphabet Soup Problem, it sorts the given string alphabetically.
For example, the word hello will be ehllo and the word hacker will be acehkr.

In the Emoticon Problem, it replace a word with an emoticon that I coded.
For example, the word smile will be replaced to ":)" and the word sad will be replaced to ":("
The output will be like this. If you input a word "Make me smile", the output will be "Make me :)"

In the Unpacking List problem, this codes shows how to access the first, middle and last list.
For example, my list is 1,2,3,4,5,6. I define that the first will be list [0], which will output 1.
while the middle, i put [1:-1], which means that all elements except the first and last.
lastly, i put[-1], for the last element.
